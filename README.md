# Moderation-Networks-on-Mastodon
Analyzed Mastodon moderation networks by building a cosine similarity network of 2,500+ instances based on activities like misinformation, hate speech, spam, and harassment. Visualized 3,000+ weighted edges and used Louvain clustering to detect 5 major communities, revealing patterns in moderation-driven structures.
